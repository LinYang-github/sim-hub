# C++ Integration Examples

This directory contains examples of how to integrate C++ applications with the SimHub Scenario Repository.

## 1. CLI Wrapper (HTTP Mode)
**Directory:** `01_cli_wrapper_http_mode`

This is the simplest integration method. It uses a standalone command-line tool (`simhub_cli`) that speaks HTTP to the SimHub API.

*   **Approach:** Encapsulation.
*   **Dependencies:** `libcurl`.
*   **Mechanism:** Uses Presigned URLs generated by the backend. The client uploads directly to MinIO via HTTP PUT.
*   **Usage:**
    ```bash
    ./simhub_cli <api_url> <scenario_name> <path_to_zip>
    ```

## 2. SDK Integration (STS Mode)
**Directory:** `02_sdk_integration_sts_mode`

This example demonstrates a deeper programmatic integration where your application acts as an S3/MinIO client.

*   **Approach:** Direct Storage Access.
*   **Dependencies:** `libcurl` (for API), MinIO/S3 C++ SDK (for upload).
*   **Mechanism:**
    1.  Call SimHub API (`mode=sts`) to obtain temporary credentials (AccessKey, SecretKey, SessionToken).
    2.  Use these credentials to initialize an S3 client.
    3.  Upload files directly using the S3 protocol.
*   **Pros:** Better performance for large files, resumption support, standard S3 compatibility.
